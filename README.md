# MemGame

An old project I made as an assignment for Year 11 SDD. It uses Visual Basic, and is coded for .NET 4.0. 

I am not sure whether the project is still holding up, to be honest, however there is a functioning build of the executable in the `Executable + Required External Resources` folder, as well as the required folder `Windows_Icon` **which must be in the same directory as the executable for it to work properly** (weird constraint, I know). 

Other than that, the appropriate documentation is present in the `Documentation` folder, and the solution files are in `Project/MemGame`.
